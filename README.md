## 🗂️ Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: 
  - Handled a dataset of 9,827 entries with no missing or duplicate values.
  - Optimized columns by transforming `Release_Date` into year-based data, splitting `Genres`, and categorizing `Vote_Average` for better analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Identified the most frequent genres, highest-rated movies, and trends in movie production over the years.
  - Examined the relationship between **popularity**, **vote count**, and **genres**.

- **Data Visualizations**:
  - Created insightful visuals using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to showcase trends and patterns.
  - Answered questions like:
    - What is the most popular genre?
    - Which year saw the highest number of movies produced?
    - Which movies achieved the highest and lowest popularity?
