## üöÄ Project Overview

Welcome to my **Netflix Data Analysis Project**, where I delve into an extensive dataset of over **9,000 movies** to uncover trends, insights, and actionable findings. This project demonstrates my expertise in **data cleaning**, **analysis**, and **visualization** using Python, and serves as a testament to my problem-solving and analytical skills.

## üóÇÔ∏è Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: 
  - Handled a dataset of 9,827 entries with no missing or duplicate values.
  - Optimized columns by transforming `Release_Date` into year-based data, splitting `Genres`, and categorizing `Vote_Average` for better analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Identified the most frequent genres, highest-rated movies, and trends in movie production over the years.
  - Examined the relationship between **popularity**, **vote count**, and **genres**.

- **Data Visualizations**:
  - Created insightful visuals using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to showcase trends and patterns.
  - Answered questions like:
    - What is the most popular genre?
    - Which year saw the highest number of movies produced?
    - Which movies achieved the highest and lowest popularity?
